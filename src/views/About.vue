                <p>The <i>Video Library</i> project is a web based interface to manage videos on a local device.</p>
                <p>I created this project in order to accomplish two main goals: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An easy way to add new videos to a single location</li>
                    <li>A way to sort videos by tags which easily identify them by their characteristics</li>
                    <li>A way to view the new videos within the same program</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="body">
            <p>For this project, I chose to use some of the more modern technologies of today, such as NodeJS and Vue.JS in order to create a web-based application. I chose to create a web-based application as desktop applications tend to be unreliable and very platform specific. In addition, since I am already confident with web-based programming languages, such as JavaScript, HTML and CSS, it would be much quicker for me to create a web-based application as opposed to a desktop-based one.</p>
            <p>I also chose a web-based application due to the fact that modern solutions, such as VSCode, Atom and even GitHub Desktop are powered by electron. This usage of server-based web technologies which can be used in desktop applications makes it easier to <b>TODO: fill this section out</b></p>
